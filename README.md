Implementation of simplex algorithm in Rust

## Why?

Had to learn simplex for university. Made sure I got it right by implementing it in Rust.

## Todo

Overall, I am happy with the code. However, the part in the optimize() function where multiple optimal solutions are handled is a bit messy. I would like to clean that up.
